# Notes:
# - Keep this file at the repository root so hosts (Streamlit Cloud, Render, etc.) can find and install it.
# - If your deployment build fails during installation (commonly due to `torch`), either:
#   * Use a Docker-based deploy with a known working base image, or
#   * Pin a CPU-only PyTorch wheel / extra-index-url appropriate for the Python version on the host,
#     or remove `torch` and handle model download/installation separately.
