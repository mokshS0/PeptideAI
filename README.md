# PeptideAI
Antimicrobial Peptide (AMP) Prediction App
A machine learning web app that predicts antimicrobial activity from peptide sequences.
Built with Python, PyTorch, and Streamlit, it uses ProtBERT embeddings to represent biological sequences and a custom neural network classifier for prediction.
Includes features for:

- AMP probability prediction

- Amino acid composition analysis

- Physicochemical property computation

- t-SNE visualization of embeddings
